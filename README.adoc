# OPA Client

Client intended to work with an OPA server over HTTP(S) or locally using wasm
policy bundles.

This repository contains a link:./library[library], and a link:./cli[cli] which
uses the library.

## Building

Currently integration tests use (a fork of) `testcontainers` crate, which
requires Docker or Podman to be running.

The setup as it stands today is through using Unix domain sockets. If using some
non-default socket location, `DOCKER_SOCKET` environment variable should be set,
pointing to the control endpoint for Docker or Podman. For podman on Linux this
can be configured by running the
link:.library/github/workflows/scripts/podman-setup.sh[podman-setup.sh]
